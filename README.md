# Automated Driving Open Research (ADORe)

## About ADORe
Eclipse ADORe is a modular software library and toolkit for decision making, planning, control and simulation of 
automated vehicles. It is developed by [The German Aerospace Center (DLR), 
 Institute for Transportation Systems ðŸ”—](https://www.dlr.de/ts/en).

ADORe provides some of the following features and capabilities:
- Algorithms and data models applied in real automated driving system for 
motion planning and control
- Mechanisms for safe interaction with other CAVs, infrastructure, traffic 
management, interactions with human-driven vehicles, bicyclists, pedestrians
 - ADORe is [ROS 2 ðŸ”—](https://ros.org) based
 - ADORe is fully containerized using [Docker ðŸ”—](https://docker.io)
 - ADORe is currently deployed on DLR TS institute research vehicles [FASCar ðŸ”—](https://www.dlr.de/en/research-and-transfer/research-infrastructure/fascar-en) and [VIEWCar IIðŸ”—](https://www.dlr.de/en/research-and-transfer/research-infrastructure/view-car)

An ADORe control system works in concert with a perception stack (not provided) to control an autonomous vehicle 
platform.
Using V2X radio messages, a list of detected objects and ego vehicle position and velocity, the ADORe control system 
provides control inputs to a vehicle platform in order to steer it along a given high-definition roadmap to the desired
goal location.
