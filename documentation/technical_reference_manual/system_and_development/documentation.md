module also offers a `make help` target. Call 'make help' to learn what it

```bash
adore(develop:c0ec4a8) (0)> make help
Usage: make <target>                                           
  cli                                       Start ADORe CLI docker context or attach to it if it is already running
  run                                       Execute a command in the ADORe CLI context `make run cmd="<command to execute>"`
  stop                                      Stop ADORe CLI docker compose context if it is running
